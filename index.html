    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for choosing <strong>Dopaflash</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect or store any personal information about you. Our App does not track your usage or gather any data that could personally identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Display of Ads:</strong> Our App displays random advertisements served by third-party ad networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Third-Party Advertisers:</strong> While we do not track or collect any personal information, the ads you see may be served by external partners who have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party ad services for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchase to Remove Ads</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ad Removal Feature:</strong> We offer an in-app purchase for $5 to remove ads from the App.
    </p>

      <strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> This payment is processed securely by Appleâ€™s App Store and is subject to their terms and privacy practices. No additional personal information is collected by us during the purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our App may include links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information available to us. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
